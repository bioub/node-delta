================================================================================

..
   class-title


Construct a new tree anchor object. The tree anchor is a pure data object
used to point to a position in the tree. The object has the following
properties:

base
     The base node of the anchor. If the anchor points at the root node,
     base is undefined.

target
     The target node this anchor points at. This node is a child node of
     base. This property may be undefined if the anchor points before or
     after the children list.

index
     The index into the children list of the base node. This property is
     undefined when the anchor points at the root of the tree.








    


Constructor

.. js:class:: Anchor(root, [base], [index])


    
    :param tree.Node root: 
        The root node of the tree. 
    
    :param tree.Node base: 
        The base node for this anchor. If index is left
        out, this parameter specifies the target node.  Otherwise it
        specifies the parent node of the target pointed at by index. 
    
    :param Number index: 
        The child index of the target node.
